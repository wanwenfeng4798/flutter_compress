# flutter_compress — LLM Integration Guide

**Purpose.** A self-contained reference for AI coding assistants integrating
`flutter_compress`. Everything needed to write correct code is in this file — no
other page needs to be fetched.

**Package:** `flutter_compress` · **This guide targets:** 2.0.0
**Source of truth:** <https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_compress>

Before integrating, check the latest version on pub.dev and use it in
`pubspec.yaml`. If the installed version differs from 2.0.0, prefer the
package's own dartdoc over this file.

**What it does.** Compresses **video** and **images** on Android, iOS and Web
using each platform's native encoder. No FFmpeg, no GPL, nothing to bundle.

---

## 0. Read this first — the five things that get written wrong

These are the mistakes an assistant makes when it guesses instead of reading.
Each is expanded later; this list exists so they are seen before any code is
written.

1. **Video and images are two separate APIs.** `compress()` is video-only.
   `compressImage()` is image-only. Passing a JPEG to `compress()` fails.
2. **Set exactly one size control.** `targetSizeMB` / `videoBitrateKbps` /
   `qualityPercent` / `quality` are ranked, not combined. Setting several does
   not "refine" the result — the highest-ranked one wins and the rest are dead
   config.
3. **Options unsupported on a platform are ignored, not approximated.** Setting
   `frameRate: 24` on Android changes nothing about the output's frame rate.
   Nothing throws. See §7.
4. **Read the result; do not assume the request was honoured.** `result.codec`,
   `result.frameRate`, `result.hasAudio`, `result.durationMs` and
   `result.format` report what was *actually written*.
5. **On Web you must release outputs.** Outputs are `blob:` URLs held for the
   life of the page. Call `releaseOutput(path)` when done, or memory grows until
   the tab dies.

---

## 1. Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_compress: ^2.0.0
```

No platform registration, no init call. The plugin registers itself.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_compress/flutter_compress.dart';

final api = FlutterCompress.instance;
```

`FlutterCompress.instance` is the only entry point. Do not construct it.

---

## 2. Platform setup

### Android

`minSdk 24`. **The plugin declares no permissions.** Do not add any on its
behalf.

It does declare one `<service>` (a declaration, not a permission), which stays
inert unless the app opts in below. It is still visible in the APK's component
list — APK inspectors like LibChecker will show
`com.compress.all.flutter_compress.CompressionService`. An app that never wants
background compression can remove it with `tools:node="remove"`; see the README.

One permission exception exists, for one call only:

| Situation | App must declare | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| `saveToDownloads()` on API ≤ 28 | `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` with `maxSdkVersion="28"` | Throws `CompressErrorCode.permissionDenied`. API 29+ needs nothing |

**Background compression is opt-in, and its notification is the app's.** The
plugin ships the foreground service but supplies **no** icon or wording — those
are prominent UI that belongs to the app. To enable it:

1. Declare `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` (+ `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` on Android 14+)
   in the **app's** manifest. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is optional — without it the
   service runs silently.
2. Pass `androidNotification` on the config:

```dart
const VideoCompressConfig(
  targetSizeMB: 10,
  androidNotification: AndroidNotification(
    smallIcon: 'drawable/ic_compress',   // "type/name" in the *app's* resources
    title: 'Compressing video',          // required; no plugin default exists
    text: 'Tap to return',               // optional
    channelName: 'Media processing',     // optional; defaults to title
  ),
);
```

**No service starts unless all three hold**, and a miss is never an error — the
plugin logs and encodes foreground-only:

| Missing | Result |
|---|---|
| `androidNotification` omitted | No service. **This is the default** |
| `smallIcon` doesn't resolve in the app | No service |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` not declared | No service |

Never invent a title or pick an icon for the user — if they ask for background
compression and haven't said what the notification should say, ask. A wrong icon
means no service at all, silently.

iOS needs none of this: the plugin already requests a background window with
`beginBackgroundTask`, which has no UI and no permission.

### iOS

Deployment target 13.0. **No `Info.plist` key is required** — the plugin reads
files by path and never touches the camera, photo library, microphone or
location. Do not add `NSCameraUsageDescription` or `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
on this plugin's behalf; if the app picks files with another package, that
package's requirements apply, not this one's.

Only if `saveToDownloads()` output should be visible in the Files app:

```xml
<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key><true/>
<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key><true/>
```

A signed privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) is bundled. Add nothing.

### Web

Requires WebCodecs — Chrome/Edge 94+, Safari 16.4+. Gate on it:

```dart
if (!await api.isSupported()) {
  // Video compression unavailable in this browser. Image compression still
  // works (canvas-based) and needs no gate.
}
```

Paths are `blob:` URLs, not filesystem paths. With `file_picker`, pass
`xFile.path` — on web that *is* a `blob:` URL. See §8 for the release rules.

---

## 3. Video — `compress()`

```dart
Future<VideoCompressResult> compress(
  String path,
  VideoCompressConfig config, {
  void Function(CompressionProgress)? onProgress,
  CancellationToken? cancellationToken,
  String? outputDirectory,
  String? outputName,
})
```

```dart
final result = await api.compress(
  inputPath,
  const VideoCompressConfig(targetSizeMB: 10),
  onProgress: (p) => debugPrint('${(p.progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
);
print('${result.outputPath} — saved ${result.savedPercent.toStringAsFixed(1)}%');
```

### `VideoCompressConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quality` | `CompressQuality` | `medium` | Preset tier: `high`/`medium`/`low`/`veryLow` |
| `qualityPercent` | `int?` | `null` | Output bitrate = N% of **source** bitrate (1–100) |
| `videoBitrateKbps` | `int?` | `null` | Explicit average video bitrate |
| `targetSizeMB` | `int?` | `null` | Desired size; the plugin derives the bitrate |
| `codec` | `VideoCodec` | `h265` | `h265` or `h264`; falls back automatically |
| `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` | `int?` | `null` | Cap dimensions; aspect kept, **only scales down** |
| `frameRate` | `double?` | `null` | Cap fps — **iOS only**, see §7 |
| `removeAudio` | `bool` | `false` | Drop the audio track |
| `audioBitrateKbps` | `int?` | `null` | Re-encode audio — **iOS only**, see §7 |
| `trim` | `TrimRange?` | `null` | `TrimRange(startMs:, endMs:)` — **not on Web** |
| `alignment` | `DimensionAlignment` | `auto16` | `auto16` rounds down to ÷16; `none` disables |
| `keepOriginalIfLarger` | `bool` | `true` | Return the source untouched if compression would grow it |
| `container` | `VideoContainer` | `auto` | `auto` keeps the source container where possible; `mp4` forces |
| `minSavingsPercent` | `int` | `0` | Return the source unless the output saves at least this much (0–99) |
| `androidNotification` | `AndroidNotification?` | `null` | Opt into background compression; **Android only**, see §2 |

### Size-control priority — set exactly one

```
targetSizeMB  →  videoBitrateKbps  →  qualityPercent  →  quality
```

The first non-null one wins; the rest are ignored entirely.

```dart
// WRONG — videoBitrateKbps and quality are dead config here.
const VideoCompressConfig(
  targetSizeMB: 10, videoBitrateKbps: 2000, quality: CompressQuality.low,
);

// RIGHT — one intent.
const VideoCompressConfig(targetSizeMB: 10);
```

Non-positive values (`targetSizeMB: 0`, `maxWidth: 0`, …) trip an assertion.
`minSavingsPercent` must be 0–99; `100` would mean "skip unless the output is
zero bytes".

### Presets — prefer these when the caller has no specific numbers

```dart
const VideoCompressConfig.forSocialMedia();   // 1080p cap, H.264, 6 Mbps, mp4
const VideoCompressConfig.maxCompression();   // 720p cap, H.265, veryLow, 10% floor
```

`forSocialMedia` uses **H.264 deliberately**, not H.265: upload pipelines that
re-encode will reject an HEVC source they cannot decode. Do not "improve" it to
H.265.

### `VideoCompressResult`

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `outputPath` | **May be the source path** when `skipped` is true |
| `originalSizeBytes` / `compressedSizeBytes` | Measured, not estimated |
| `width` / `height` | Actual output dimensions |
| `durationMs` | **Output** duration — compare with the source to detect truncation |
| `codec` | `"h264"` or `"h265"` — what was used, which may not be what was requested |
| `frameRate` | `double?` — actual; `null` when the platform can't report it |
| `hasAudio` | `bool?` — whether the output has an audio track |
| `skipped` | True when the original was returned untouched |
| `compressionRatio` / `savedPercent` | Derived getters |

**`skipped` matters.** When true, `outputPath` is the *input* file. Do not
delete it as if it were a temporary output, and do not call `releaseOutput()` on
it on Web (the plugin guards this, but the intent should be explicit).

### Pre-flight estimate — no encoding

```dart
final CompressionEstimate est = await api.estimate(path, config);
// est.estimatedSizeBytes, estimatedBitrateKbps, targetWidth, targetHeight
```

### Other video calls

```dart
final VideoInfo info = await api.getVideoInfo(path);
final String thumb = await api.getThumbnail(path, positionMs: 1000, maxWidth: 320);
final bool busy = await api.isCompressing();
```

`getThumbnail` returns a file path on mobile and a `data:` URL on Web.

---

## 4. Images — `compressImage()`

A **separate API**. Never route an image through `compress()`.

```dart
Future<ImageCompressResult> compressImage(
  String path,
  ImageCompressConfig config, {
  String? outputDirectory,
  String? outputName,
})
```

```dart
final r = await api.compressImage(
  path,
  const ImageCompressConfig(targetSizeKB: 200, maxWidth: 2560),
);
print('${r.format} ${r.width}x${r.height} — ${r.savedPercent.toStringAsFixed(1)}%');
```

### `ImageCompressConfig`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | `ImageFormat?` | `null` | **`null` keeps the source's format.** `jpeg`/`png`/`webp`/`heic` |
| `quality` | `int` | `85` | 1–100; ignored when `targetSizeKB` is set or `lossless` is true |
| `targetSizeKB` | `int?` | `null` | Highest-priority size control; the engine searches quality, then downscales |
| `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` | `int?` | `null` | Cap; only scales down |
| `keepExif` | `bool` | `false` | See §7 — **JPEG only on Android, not on Web** |
| `lossless` | `bool` | `false` | Pixel-identical re-encode; ignores `targetSizeKB` |
| `keepOriginalIfLarger` | `bool` | `true` | Return the source untouched if the result would be larger |
| `minSavingsPercent` | `int` | `0` | Return the source unless the output saves at least this much (0–99) |

**Leave `format` null unless the app genuinely needs a conversion.** A null
format preserves JPEG as JPEG, PNG as PNG — which is what callers almost always
want.

**`lossless` frequently produces a *larger* file** (re-encoding an
already-compressed JPEG cannot beat the original). That is why
`keepOriginalIfLarger` defaults to true: the result comes back `skipped` with
the original path. This is correct behaviour, not a failure.

```dart
// Convenience wrapper — keeps the source format, sets lossless.
final r = await api.compressImageLossless(path);
```

### `ImageCompressResult`

`outputPath`, `originalSizeBytes`, `compressedSizeBytes`, `width`, `height`,
`format` (**actually written**, may differ from the request), `skipped`, plus
`compressionRatio` / `savedPercent`.

```dart
final ImageMeta meta = await api.getImageInfo(path);
```

### Presets

```dart
const ImageCompressConfig.forAvatar();        // 512px cap, JPEG, q80
const ImageCompressConfig.forSocialMedia();   // 2048px cap, 500 KB, source format, EXIF dropped
```

`forSocialMedia` drops EXIF on purpose — uploading a photo with its GPS tags
intact is a privacy leak, not a feature.

### `compressImageBytes` — when the source is not a file

```dart
Future<ImageBytesResult> compressImageBytes(
  Uint8List source,
  ImageCompressConfig config,
)
```

```dart
final result = await api.compressImageBytes(
  await xFile.readAsBytes(),
  const ImageCompressConfig(targetSizeKB: 200),
);
await upload(result.bytes);   // nothing on disk, nothing to release
```

**Use this whenever the bytes are already in memory** — an `image_picker`
`XFile`, a camera frame, a download. Writing a temp file just to obtain a path is
the mistake this method exists to remove.

`ImageBytesResult`: `bytes`, `originalSizeBytes`, `compressedSizeBytes` (a getter
over `bytes.length`), `width`, `height`, `format`, `skipped`, plus
`compressionRatio` / `savedPercent`. When `skipped` is true, `bytes` **is the
source array you passed in**.

**There is no `compressVideoBytes`, by design.** A video would mean copying tens
of megabytes through the platform channel in one message. Use `compress()` with a
path for video.

---

## 5. Batches

Both run **sequentially**, not in parallel — parallel hardware encodes contend
for the same encoder and are slower, not faster.

```dart
final videos = await api.compressAll(
  paths, config,
  onItemProgress: (index, p) => …,
  cancellationToken: token,
  continueOnError: true,
  onItemError: (index, path, error) => …,
);

final images = await api.compressImages(
  paths, config,
  onItemDone: (index, total) => …,
  continueOnError: true,
);
```

With `continueOnError: true` a failing item is **omitted from the result**, so
the returned list may be shorter than `paths`. Match items by `onItemError`
index, not by list position.

A cancel is never treated as an item failure: `compressAll` rethrows it even
with `continueOnError: true`. For `compressImages` the token is checked
**between items** — an image already being encoded finishes first, which is
harmless because images take milliseconds.

---

## 6. Progress, cancellation, errors

### Progress

```dart
// Per-job:
await api.compress(path, config, onProgress: (p) => print(p.progress));

// Global stream (useful for a batch UI):
api.progressStream.listen((p) => print('${p.id} ${p.progress}'));
```

`CompressionProgress`: `id`, `progress` (0.0–1.0), `estimatedRemainingMs?`,
`currentOutputBytes?`.

### Cancellation

```dart
final token = CancellationToken();
final future = api.compress(path, config, cancellationToken: token);
await token.cancel();          // aborts; the future throws
```

**A token latches.** Reusing one without `token.reset()` cancels the next job
immediately.

```dart
token.reset();                 // required before reuse
```

`api.cancel([id])` cancels one job; `api.cancelAll()` cancels everything.

### Errors

Catch the plugin's own types. `PlatformException` never escapes the API.

```dart
try {
  await api.compress(path, config);
} on CompressCancelled {                 // marker: both video & image cancels
  // user aborted
} on VideoCompressException catch (e) {
  if (e.code == CompressErrorCode.unsupported) { … }
} on CompressException catch (e) {       // base type for everything
  …
}
```

| Type | Raised by |
|---|---|
| `CompressException` | base class for all of the below |
| `VideoCompressException` | video calls |
| `ImageCompressException` | image calls |
| `VideoCompressCancelledException` | video cancel — also a `CompressCancelled` |
| `ImageCompressCancelledException` | image cancel — also a `CompressCancelled` |

`CompressErrorCode` constants: `cancelled`, `infoFailed`, `estimateFailed`,
`compressFailed`, `thumbnailFailed`, `saveFailed`, `imageInfoFailed`,
`imageCompressFailed`, `badArguments`, `noEngine`, `unsupported`,
`permissionDenied`.

`permissionDenied` is **Android-only** today: `saveToDownloads()` on API ≤ 28
without `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`. Handle it by telling the user to grant storage
access — never by adding the permission silently on their behalf.

Compare `e.code` against these constants. Never parse `e.message` — its wording
is not stable.

---

## 7. Platform capability matrix — ❌ means *ignored*, not approximated

This is the section most likely to produce wrong code if skipped. An option
marked ❌ is silently dropped: nothing throws, and the output simply does not
have the requested property.

### Video

| Capability | Android | iOS | Web |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Target size / bitrate / quality | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| H.265 with H.264 fallback | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ ¹ |
| `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `frameRate` | ❌ ² | ✅ | ❌ ² |
| `removeAudio` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ audio always dropped |
| `audioBitrateKbps` | ❌ ³ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `trim` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Thumbnail / info / estimate | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Progress / cancel / batch | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Background compression | ⚠️ opt-in ⁵ | ✅ background task | n/a |

¹ Web uses HEVC only where the browser's WebCodecs supports encoding it,
otherwise H.264. Read `result.codec`.
² Only iOS decimates frames. Media3 has no frame-dropping effect and the web
pipeline re-encodes every decoded frame; on both, `frameRate` only feeds the
bitrate maths. Read `result.frameRate`.
³ Media3 1.4.x exposes no audio-encoder settings; Android encodes AAC at its own
default. The value still shapes the `targetSizeMB` budget.

### Image

| Capability | Android | iOS | Web |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Target size / quality | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| JPEG / PNG / WebP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HEIC | ⚠️ device encoder only, else JPEG | ✅ | ❌ |
| `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `keepExif` | ⚠️ JPEG only ⁴ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `compressImageBytes` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

⁵ Android requires `androidNotification` **and** the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
permission (see §2). Without either, the encode is foreground-only — that is the
design, not an error condition.

⁴ Android copies 48 EXIF tags into JPEG output. iOS passes the source's metadata
through wholesale. Web's canvas re-encode strips metadata entirely — no workaround
exists, so do not offer a "keep EXIF" switch on web.

**Consequence for generated code:** never present an ignored option to the user
as if it worked. If a UI exposes a frame-rate slider, gate it on
`defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS`, or surface `result.frameRate`
afterwards.

---

## 8. Output files and Web memory

### Where output goes

| | Default | With `outputDirectory` / `outputName` |
|---|---|---|
| Android / iOS | plugin cache dir, `<source-name>_<timestamp>.<ext>` | as given |
| Web | a `blob:` URL | both parameters are ignored |

**`outputName` is a base name, not a file name.** Pass it without an extension.
If one is supplied it is stripped — `'photo.jpg'` yields `photo.<real-ext>`, not
`photo.jpg.jpg` — because the extension is always derived from what was actually
encoded. It follows that `outputName` **cannot change the output format**:
video format comes from `container` (and the platform), image format from
`format`.

Extension rules: video keeps the source container unless `container:
VideoContainer.mp4`; images keep the source format unless `format` is set.

### Saving

```dart
final String saved = await api.saveToDownloads(result.outputPath);
// Android → MediaStore Downloads · iOS → app Documents · Web → browser download
```

### Releasing — mandatory on Web

```dart
await api.releaseOutput(result.outputPath);  // one output
await api.clearCache();                      // everything
```

On Android/iOS these delete cache files. **On Web they revoke blob URLs**, which
is the only way to free the encoded bytes — the browser otherwise holds every
output for the life of the page. Release as soon as the result has been
uploaded, downloaded or rendered.

Do not call `releaseOutput` on a path you still display in an `<img>`/`Image.network`.

## 9. Complete worked example

```dart
import 'package:flutter_compress/flutter_compress.dart';

Future<String?> shrinkVideo(String inputPath) async {
  final api = FlutterCompress.instance;

  if (!await api.isSupported()) return null;      // web without WebCodecs

  final token = CancellationToken();
  try {
    final result = await api.compress(
      inputPath,
      const VideoCompressConfig(
        targetSizeMB: 10,                          // one size control only
        codec: VideoCodec.h265,                    // auto-falls back to H.264
        maxWidth: 1280,
        maxHeight: 1280,
      ),
      onProgress: (p) => debugPrint('${(p.progress * 100).round()}%'),
      cancellationToken: token,
    );

    if (result.skipped) {
      // Nothing was written — outputPath is the original file.
      return inputPath;
    }

    debugPrint('codec=${result.codec} '                 // what actually happened
        'fps=${result.frameRate} audio=${result.hasAudio} '
        'duration=${result.durationMs}ms');

    await uploadFile(result.outputPath);
    await api.releaseOutput(result.outputPath);         // required on web
    return result.outputPath;
  } on CompressCancelled {
    return null;
  } on CompressException catch (e) {
    debugPrint('compression failed: ${e.code}');
    return null;
  }
}
```

## 10. Integration checklist

- [ ] `flutter_compress` in `pubspec.yaml` at the current pub.dev version
- [ ] Video uses `compress()`; images use `compressImage()` — never crossed
- [ ] Exactly **one** size control set per config
- [ ] `isSupported()` gates video on Web
- [ ] `result.skipped` handled — `outputPath` may be the source
- [ ] Actual values read from the result, not assumed from the config
- [ ] `releaseOutput()` or `clearCache()` called on Web after use
- [ ] `CancellationToken.reset()` before reuse
- [ ] Errors caught as `CompressException` / `CompressCancelled`, not `PlatformException`
- [ ] `e.code` compared against `CompressErrorCode`, never `e.message` parsed
- [ ] Android: no permission added except `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` for legacy
      `saveToDownloads`, or the app's own background service
- [ ] No `NS*UsageDescription` added on this plugin's behalf
- [ ] `compressImageBytes()` used when the source is already in memory — no
      temp file written just to get a path
- [ ] Options marked ❌ for a platform are not exposed as working in the UI

## 11. Common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it matters | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Passing an image to `compress()` | Video engine can't open it; runtime failure | Use `compressImage()` |
| Setting `targetSizeMB` *and* `videoBitrateKbps` | Lower-priority fields silently ignored; intent unclear | Set one |
| Assuming `frameRate` applies everywhere | Android/Web ignore it; output fps is unchanged | Gate on iOS or read `result.frameRate` |
| Assuming `config.codec` is what shipped | H.265 falls back to H.264 on unsupported hardware | Read `result.codec` |
| Treating `outputPath` as always a new file | With `skipped: true` it is the **source** — deleting it destroys the user's file | Check `result.skipped` first |
| Never calling `releaseOutput` on Web | Every output stays in memory for the page's life | Release after use |
| Reusing a `CancellationToken` | It latches; the next job aborts instantly | `token.reset()` |
| Catching `PlatformException` | Never thrown by this API; the catch is dead code | Catch `CompressException` |
| Adding camera/photo `Info.plist` keys | Plugin needs none; unjustified keys invite App Store questions | Only the file-picker package's keys |
| Adding Android permissions "because the plugin needs them" | It declares none and needs none; every one you add is yours to justify at review | Add only for your own background service or legacy `saveToDownloads` |
| Looking for `keepAliveInBackground` | Replaced in 2.0.0 by `androidNotification` | Pass an `AndroidNotification`, or omit it for no service |
| Inventing a notification title or icon | A wrong icon silently disables the service; invented copy ships in the user's app | Ask what it should say, or omit `androidNotification` |
| Treating a foreground-only encode as a failure | That is simply what Android does without the app's own service — nothing throws | Nothing to handle |
| `outputName: 'photo.png'` to get a PNG | The name never sets the format — the extension is stripped and the real format wins | `format: ImageFormat.png` |
| Parallel `Future.wait` over videos | Hardware encoders contend; slower and can fail | `compressAll()` |
| Writing a temp file to compress bytes you already hold | Pointless IO, plus a file you now have to clean up | `compressImageBytes()` |
| Looking for `compressVideoBytes` | Doesn't exist — a video through one channel message is a memory spike | `compress()` with a path |
| Hand-tuning a config for a common case | Easy to set two size controls by accident | A preset (`forSocialMedia()`, `forAvatar()`, …) |
| `lossless: true` "failing" because the file grew | Expected for already-compressed sources | Handle `skipped` |

## 13. How to use this document

1. Read §0 before writing any code.
2. Pick the API by media type (§3 video, §4 images) — they never mix.
3. Check §7 for every option used, on every platform the app targets. If an
   option is ❌ anywhere, either gate it per-platform or report the actual value
   from the result.
4. Handle `skipped`, cancellation and errors per §6 and §8.
5. Walk §10 before declaring the integration done, and check the work against
   §11.

If asked for something this guide does not cover, say so rather than inventing
an API. The full dartdoc ships with the package, and the source is at
<https://github.com/chenkaiHere/flutter_compress>.
